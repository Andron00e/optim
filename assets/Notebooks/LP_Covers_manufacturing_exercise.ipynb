Storing 1000 headphones covers (packaging included) takes up 30 cubic feet of space. Storing 1000 phone covers (packaging included) takes up 50 cubic feet of space, and storing 1000 laptop covers (packaging included) takes up 220 cubic feet of space.

        "The marketing department estimates that the weekly demand for headphones covers, phone, and laptop covers does not exceed 9000 and 14000, and 7000 units, therefore the company does not want to produce more than these amounts for headphones, phone, and laptop covers. \n",
